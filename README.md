# Chatbot-With-Rule-Based
✅ Description:
A Rule-Based Chatbot is a simple chatbot that responds to user messages using predefined rules or conditions. It does not use machine learning or AI models. Instead, it checks the user’s input using techniques like if-else conditions or pattern matching and replies with a fixed response.

This project is a great starting point to understand Natural Language Processing (NLP), conversation flow, and how chatbots work in a basic form.

✅ Key Features:
Responds to greetings like "Hi", "Hello", or "How are you?"

Answers common questions like "What is your name?" or "What can you do?"

Uses simple Python code with if-elif-else statements or regular expressions.

Can handle unknown or unexpected inputs with a default message.

✅ Technologies Used:
Python

(Optional) Regex module (import re) for pattern matching

(Optional) Text-based interface (Terminal or Command Prompt)

✅ What I Learned (Self-Learned Skills):
How to use if-else statements to make decisions in a chatbot.

Basics of string handling and pattern matching.

How to simulate a human-like conversation using fixed rules.

Understanding how chatbots work before learning AI-based chatbots.

✅ Example Conversation:

Edit
You: Hi
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?

You: What is your name?
Bot: I am your virtual assistant chatbot.

You: What can you do?
Bot: I can answer basic questions using rule-based logic.

You: Bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
✅ Advantages of Rule-Based Chatbots:
Very easy to build and understand.

No need for datasets or training.

Lightweight and fast.

Perfect for simple tasks or FAQ-based bots.

✅ Limitations:
Can’t understand new or complex questions.

Only works on fixed inputs (not intelligent).

No learning ability.
